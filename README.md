# Contribute data to mangal.io

**Thank you for contributing your data**. The aim of this repository is to make the submission process as easy as possible. In fact, we will do the actual injection in the database *for you*. Why? There are a few reasons:

- we know how to do it!
- we know how to troubleshoot it!
- you have other things to do!

## How can I contribute?

There are three steps to submitting a dataset (and one of them is only taking a few seconds!)

### Signing up as a mangal user

This is not something you actually have to do. If you have an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) ID, all you need to do is click on <https://mangal.io/auth>, login with ORCID, and you will have an account. We will ask for your ORCID during the submission process if you want it to be linked to the data.

That's it.
